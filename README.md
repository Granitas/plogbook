Console application for personal logging, which turns logs into readable html pages. The logs (called plogs) are located in categories which are part of the plogbook.

It's written as a single python file which should run on both python 2 and python 3. Only tested on Linux but should run on Windows and Mac Os as well.

For examples see /examples/.
