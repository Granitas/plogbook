            <p>Ugh, worked all night adding support for templating. Got this idea today actually and I thought it would solve my problem of 'keeping too much stuff in .py' so now the user can just build out templates and edit them instead of editing the .py file which is definitely easier. Only issue is handingling the .format but I think it's ok for a template to have some strict rules.</p><p>So yeah took my quite a while to get everything working nicely but it does! Also reworked some argparse options and was thinking of sorting -h output but it's more difficult than expectations so maybe tomorrow...</p><p>Other than that I don't really have huge ideas right now aside from doing a lot of testing since I did write a lot of exception catching so a lot of nasty errors will appear if something goes wrong. I have to be honest here I'm not too excited for that, thoug so far everything runs great and maybe there won't be as much work as I think there would be.</p><p></p><p>Did a lot of work, proud! o/</p><p></p><p></p>
