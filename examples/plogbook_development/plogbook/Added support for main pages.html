            <p>So before I took a nap today I got a great idea of converting everything into a website. Took me quite a while to set it up though I do have admit I've spent more time on html/css bit than on the programming itself. Css is just hard man...</p><p>The other thing that might have made the process somewhat longer than expectations is that I've been watching dota summit 2 which is really awesome, currently they are playing attack on Tokyo board game which looks pretty damn fun and I would like to try it out.</p><p>Next on the list is support for plogbook wide main.html page that would point to every directory, will do that tomorrow probably if I don't get worked out at work.</p><p>Cheers, I'm out! </p><p></p>
