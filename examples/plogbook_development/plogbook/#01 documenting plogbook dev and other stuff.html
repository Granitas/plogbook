            <p>I've decied to start a plogbook for the development of plogbook. So these are the featuers I'm thinking of adding in no particular order: <ul><li>Support for input via other means like nano or kate instead of console input which is really restricting it seems, this is pretty big so would need to look into more</li><li>Various html conversions such as converint external @src in img tag to a file in plogbook directory</li><li>maybe moving to markdown? not sure how that would work but I think typing markdown would be easier than typing html if you want to use all of the benefits, but again this is pretty big so need to do quite a bit of research </li></ul></p><p>Other than that I'm quite happy with what I have so far, it's definitely pretty usable at the current state and I can only think of convience stuff and better windows support.</p><p>Entry #01, o/</p><p></p>
